# Obesity Level Prediction
This is a project I made for my Model Deployment final exam. The goal is to predict someone’s obesity level based on their BMI.\
🟢 Backend: FastAPI\
🟢 Frontend: Streamlit

## ✨ What it does
- Takes BMI input
- Predicts obesity level
- Shows results in a simple web app

## 🚀 Features
- Predict obesity level from user BMI input
- Backend powered by FastAPI (model serving)
- Interactive frontend built with Streamlit
- Simple and lightweight deployment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- Machine Learning model (trained on BMI-based data)

## 📌 Usage
- Enter the required data in the Streamlit app.
- The app will call the FastAPI backend and return your predicted obesity level.
